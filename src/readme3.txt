Simple Circle limiting behavior:
 - Laplacian: the shape tends to a smooth circle
 - Osculating Circle: the shape tends to a smooth circle
Figure 8 limiting behavior:
 - Laplacian: the shape tends to a flat line
 - Osculating Circle: the shape tends to a fully convex warped circle
Limacon limiting behavior:
 - Laplacian: the inner loop is slowly unwrapped, in a manner superficially similar to reducing the b constant in the equation.
 - Osculating Circle: the inner loop is unwrapped, but in a more messy way-- the points become jagged towards the end
3D Curve limiting behavior:
 - Laplacian: tends to a smooth circle, but the Z-tilt slowly diminishes as iterations increase
 - Osculating Circle: the shape tends to a smooth circle at small timesteps, but starts drifting and becoming deformed chaotically at large timesteps. Z values also appear to slowly become the same
