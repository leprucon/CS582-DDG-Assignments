# Digital Geometry Processing, Fall 2024

Welcome to Digital Geometry Processing! In this class, we will be implementing various algorithms on geometric data. The weekly assignments will be implemented with the help of three (extremely popular!) libraries: [Geometry Central](https://geometry-central.net/surface/geometry/geometry/) (for manipulation of geometric data), [Polyscope](https://polyscope.run/) (for visualization of said data), and [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (for numerical linear algebra) . We will use this repo for all course assignments. It will be updated by the course staff at certain points during the semester. We will provide instructions on how to update your local copy (should be no harder than running `git pull` in your terminal).
